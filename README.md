# Demo2Final
This is the repository for DEMO 2 FINAL.
Like the original Demo 2, there is python code to detect the marker and transmit the data from the PI to the Arduino.
There is also Arduino code that reads in these values and performs the appropriate movements.
For this demo, there was no simulink simulation done, the robot was tuned using trial and error. 

To decrease our overall time and increase scores, the forward motion, rotation, and circle movement were all sped up
The areas that were changed are indicated by commented sections in the code
